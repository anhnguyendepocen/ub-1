The Spanish region of the firm is identified using the firm's location based on information on the region in which they have their R\&D department.\footnote{This novel identification strategy for regions is developed by Enrique López-Bazo.} This implies that the modified dataset will be limited to single-unit firms.

Dependent variables
\begin{itemize}
  \item Sales of new products (share of total sales constituted by products, invented within the past two years).
  \item Robustness check: Absolute number of patent applications.
\end{itemize}
Main explanatory variables
\begin{itemize}
  \item Innovations in products within the past two years (possibly interacted with one of the follownig).
  \item Variables on R\&D’s share of total personnel and total payments.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Possibly disaggregated into researchers, technicians and clerks.
  \end{itemize}
  \item Spacially weighted R\&D expenditures (as share of total sales) for all firms within the same sector.
  \item Spacially weighted R\&D expenditures (as share of total sales) for all firms.
\end{itemize}
Controls
\begin{itemize}
  \item	Statistical Classification of Economic Activities (NACE2/CNAE2009 \& CNAE93).
  \begin{itemize}
    \item E.g. dummies of one digit sector number (possibly with a few corrections)
    \item More irrelevant sectors should probably be dropped from the dataset.
  \end{itemize}
  \item Sectoral reliance on innovation, inspired by \citet{barrios2001explaining}:
  \begin{align*}
    \frac{\text{New products as share of total sales in sector }j}{\text{New products as share of total sales in all sectors}}
  \end{align*}
  \item Sectoral level of R\&D spendings:
  \begin{align*}
    \frac{\text{R\&D spendings in sector }j}{\text{R\&D spendings in all sectors}}
  \end{align*}
  \item Innovations in process within the past two years.
  \item	Investments in physical stock.
  \item	Exports.
  \item	Belonging to a business group.
  \item	Type of business (1=Pública; 2=Privada nacional; 3=Privada multinacional; 4=Asociación de investigación y otras instituciones de investigación).
  \item	Firm size (number of employees).
\end{itemize}
