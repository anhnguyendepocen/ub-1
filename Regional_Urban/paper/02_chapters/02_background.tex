\subsection{Theory of firm-level innovations}
\label{subsec:theory}
I modify the “modified regional knowledge production function” proposed by \citet{ohUallach2007rethinking} by no longer assuming other influences to be random and uncorrelated, but also letting R\&D spending in other firms within the region affect firm-level innovations.

As analyzed by \citet{harrison2014does}, though primarily positive, the effect of R\&D spendings and introduction of new products in other firms can be expected to capture effects in two directions: while there can be positive spill-overs through development, interaction and exchange of human capital and technology there is also the risk that sales in other firms might take over market shares.

\subsection{Results in other studies}
\label{subsec:other_studies}
\citet{barrios2001explaining} measure the effects of R\&D spendings and regional spillovers on firms' export from Spain. \citet{harrison2014does} estimate the effects of innovations on employment growth in Spanish firms using the PITEC database. \citet{vogel2015two} find effects of R\&D spendings and evidence of local technology spillovers through her estimation of a long run model for convergence in Total Factor Productivity (TFP) between all European regions. However, \citet{sternberg2001firm} found regional characteristics and regional between-firm spillovers to be of less importance than the characteristics of the individual firm itself.
