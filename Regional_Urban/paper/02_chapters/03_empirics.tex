The aim is to model the firm level inventions, measured as share of sales due to new products, as a function of within-firm R\&D spendings as well as the average share R\&D spendings in other firms within the region. That is, for firms within the same sector and in other sectors respectively. I use a panel regression controlling for time-constant firm-level random effects using GLS which provides efficient, though not consistent estimates due to the presence of endogeneity. As opposed to a Fixed Effects model this however allows for both the inclusion of time-invariant controls as well as using cluster robust standard errors.\footnote{The STATA do-files can be accessed from \href{https://github.com/thornoe/ub/tree/master/Regional_Urban/paper/stata_code}{github.com/thornoe/ub/tree/master/Regional\_Urban/paper/stata\_code}}
