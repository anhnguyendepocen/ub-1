In this paper determinants of the sales of new products as a share of total revenue is analyzed for Spanish firms for the period 2005-2016. Using the PITEC database the region of the firm is identified through the main location of its R\&D personnel. Though regional controls sort out some of the heterogeneity firm-level R\&D activity greatly surpasses potential regional spillovers from R\&D spending in other firms. Especially continuous internal basic research drives the product innovation in the long-run.
