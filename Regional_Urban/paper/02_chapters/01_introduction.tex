In a global competition a firm's ability to innovate and come up with new and successful products is crucial for the development of the firm as well as regional growth and jobs.

Innovations is not just the result of isolated research and development (R\&D) processes within firms but can also be expected to be driven up by knowledge spillovers from a high share of R\&D spending in other firms within the same region by the means of formal and informal interactions between firms and employees of different firms. Though I do not find significant spillovers from regional R\&D expenses a few of the regional dummies correct some of the heteroscedasticity in the estimation. The internal R\&D activity seem to be the more important, especially the continuity of in-house research.

I proceed by outlining the theoretical background in section \ref{sec:background}, the empirical strategy and the data in section \ref{sec:empirics} and \ref{sec:data} respectively, before presenting the results in \ref{sec:conclusion} and concluding in \ref{sec:conclusion}.
