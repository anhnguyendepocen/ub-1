The Danish "free municipalities" is a very interesting opportunity for accessing whether it would be efficient to loosen the regulation about the length of job training programs. Though experimental design Allowing two municipalities to loosen the restriction to 13 and 26 week respectively is probably the best feasible way to investigate whether there are decreasing or increasing returns to the length of the program. The experimental design is suboptimal for unbiased effect assessment as the optimal design would be to randomly draw unemployed to be eligible for different types of treatment within all municipalities. However, this is highly unrealistic due to the costly implementation and questionable moral aspect in individuals randomly being much worse off than a next door fellow citizen.

However difference-in-differences design could allow for an approximate estimate, possibly using municipal level controls if pre treatment period trends are too different. Furthermore IV based fuzzy Regressions in Discontinuity Design could be used for an extensive evaluation using micro data from combining administrative registries.
