\begin{abstract}\noindent
The aim of this paper is to suggest and discuss possible research designs in order to evaluate the effects of allowing public employment agencies to offer prolonged job training programs to those in risk of long-term unemployment. This policy was tested in two Danish municipalities from 2014-2015.

A difference-in-differences design has potential to evaluate these experiments but has inbuild weaknesses due to selection into treatment and potential different pre-treatment trends between municipalities.
