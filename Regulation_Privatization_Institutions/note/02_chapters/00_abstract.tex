\begin{abstract}\noindent
The number of municipalities in Japan was almost halved through several hundred municipal mergers spread out over the first decade of the \nth{21} Century. The shocks to local political power from mergers can be used to analyze the value of political connections for firms owned by family members of local politicians.

Japan is perceived as a low-corruption corruption environment with very strong and transparent public institutions. If political connections are also of high value here it becomes difficult to imagine there exists a country in which rent seeking and favoritism does not take place.
