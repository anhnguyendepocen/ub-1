The continuous merging and status changes of Japanese municipalities form the basis for a unique identification strategy where high variety in characteristics of municipalities and in timing of mergers allow for robust estimation of the profitability of political connections for firms in which family members or the politician herself has economic interests.

Purposely choosing to investigate the value of political connections in a country which arguably is the least corrupt non-city-state in Asia logically dampens expectations of finding significant results. However, this exact premise is what would make significant results that much more sensational. In Denmark the performance of a firm has already shown to double when the political power of a family-related politician doubles. If political connections show to be of equally high value for firm-owners in the least corrupt countries at either end of the World which country will then be free of corruption?
