This paper suggests a research design to evaluate the value of family connections to local politicians for firm-owners in Japan. Most literature on the value of political connections has been studying either Western economies or countries with a very high level of perceived corruption in the public sector. A study of the value of political connections in Japan would first of all fill a gap as little to no litterature has gone in-depth with the value of political connections in Japan or other a low-corruption countries in Asia.

Moreover, the continuous decrease in the number of municipalities as well as their status provides rich variation in the power of reelected local politicians across time that enable difference-in-differences panel regressions.

In section \ref{sec:background} I review the more relevant literature on the value of political connections in general and related to Japan in particular. After touching on the timeline of mergers the necessary data is describes before outlining the empirical strategy for estimation and robustness checks in section \ref{sec:empirics}. Lastly I suggest the expected results in \ref{sec:results} and conclude on the potential contribution of the research design in \ref{sec:conclusion}.
