This papers suggests a research design in order to evaluate the value of local political connections in Japan

Most litterature on the value of political connections has been in either Western economies or in countries with a much higher level of perceived corruption in the public sector. A study of the value of political connections in Japan, on the other hand, is not only an interesting new contribution to the litterature as the perceived corruption of their public sector is about at level with that of the United States and Ireland while having a very different political culture. Moreover, the continous decrease in the number of municipalities as well as their status provides rich variation in the power of reelected local politicians across time.
