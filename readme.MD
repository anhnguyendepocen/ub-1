    - [*Prolonged job training programs: A research note*](https://github.com/thornoe/ub/blob/master/Analysis_Evaluation/note/main.pdf). Proposing a research design for evaluating the effect of prolonged job training programs for those in risk of long-term unemployment. A policy tested by two Danish municipalities.
* In **Ecological Economics** w. Mònica Serrano:

    - [Stata-code](https://github.com/thornoe/ub/tree/master/Macroeconometrics/PS2/stata_code) for [*Cointegration analysis*](https://github.com/thornoe/ub/blob/master/Macroeconometrics/PS2/main.pdf).
* In **Panel Data** w. Vicente Royuela Mora:
    - [Stata-code](https://github.com/thornoe/ub/tree/master/Panel_data/paper/stata_code) for [*Economic impacts of internal and external R&D processes over time: How and when sales of new products are increased*](https://github.com/thornoe/ub/blob/master/Panel_data/paper/main.pdf). Comparing the Between, Fixed Effects, and Random Effects estimators using the PITEC panel of Spanish firms. Lagged and persistent effects of both internal and external R&D spendings are analyzed using leads of different length for the sales of new products.

    - [Stata-code](https://github.com/thornoe/ub/tree/master/Regional_Urban/paper/stata_code) for [*Invention and sales of new products: Is the firm or the region key?*](https://github.com/thornoe/ub/blob/master/Regional_Urban/paper/main.pdf). Examining potential spillover effects from internal R&D spending in other firms within the region. Heterogeneity between the manufacturing and service sector in terms of which types of R&D activities are productive.
* In **Regulation, Privatization & Institutions** w. Germà Bel:
    - [*The value of local political connections in Japan: A research note*](https://github.com/thornoe/ub/blob/master/Regulation_Privatization_Institutions/note/main.pdf). Motivating and suggesting a comprehensive research design for examining the value of political connections for firms owned by family members of local politicians using the shocks to political power provided by a series of municipal mergers in Japan.
* In **Public Economics II: Theory of Taxation** w. Javier Vázquez-Grenno:
    - [*Discrepancy in the Elasticity of Taxable Income: A litterature review*](https://github.com/thornoe/ub/blob/master/Theory_Taxation/survey/main.pdf). Analysing differences in the estimated size of the Elasticity of Taxable Income between studies using different estimation methods and carried out on data covering different tax reforms in the US and Denmark respectively.

### Presentations

    - [*Application of Regression Discontinuity Design: The impact of tracking in Kenyan primary schools*](https://github.com/thornoe/ub/blob/master/Analysis_Evaluation/rdd/rdd_tracking.pdf).
