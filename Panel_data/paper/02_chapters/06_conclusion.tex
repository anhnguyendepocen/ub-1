The preferred model in table \ref{tab:controls} imply that internal R\&D activity in year $t$ should raise the share of new products with around eight percentage points of total turnover not only within the same year but especially in the coming 1-2 years. In the absence of internal R\&D activities external R\&D expenditure can raise the share of new products significantly, but the effects is obviously less persistent. The RE estimates are as is often the case inconsistent, though more efficient than the FE estimates. Including even more regional controls and other corrections for heteroscedasticity could possibly fix this issue. However, the direction and the overall significance of the effects is recurring across the FE, RE, and to some degree the BE estimator.
