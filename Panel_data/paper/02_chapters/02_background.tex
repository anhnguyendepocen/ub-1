Innovation driven growth has been a contested topic throughout the era of modern economics. \citet{sternberg2001firm} carried out a comparative study in ten different regions show that firm level innovations are both determined by internal characteristics of the individual firm and by outside determinants including both intra-regional and extra-regional factors. However, the PITEC dataset that we use has a very low level of disaggregated regional information on location of firms. On the bright side external factors has been found to be of less importance than the firm-level determinants \citep{sternberg2001firm}.

\citet{segarra2014high} uses the PITEC to quantify the impact of R\%D processes not only on the probability of innovating but on economic growth of the firm. They find a significant presence of heterogeneity. Applying quantile regression internal R\&D activity mainly has a sizeable effect for high-growth firms while external R\&D expenses mainly benefit below-median-growth firms.
