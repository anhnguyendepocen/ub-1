The panel can be constructed by merging the monthly payroll (eIncome) register from the Danish tax authority (SKAT) and other administrative registers at Statistics Denmark. With the specifications used by \citet{kreiner2016tax} the sample size was a treatment group of 219,179 individuals and a control group of 109,500 individuals with weak or no incentives to income-shifting following the 2010 tax reform. As I include more years the panel would decrease a bit.
