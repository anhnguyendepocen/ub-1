\begin{abstract}\noindent
The elasticity of taxable income captures most responses to the marginal tax rate including labour supply responses as well as career choices, avoidance, and evasion. By surveying 5 studies in the U.S. and Denmark a sizable discrepancy is found between the elasticity estimates. While improvements in data availability and estimation methods can explain a lot, there also seem to be some institutional differences that cause higher frictions and less options for avoidance in Denmark relative to the U.S.

In general Danish studies find the elasticity of taxable income to be close to zero except for the groups that have the best access to intertemporal income-shifting and deductions.
