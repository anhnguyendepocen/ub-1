 {\textit{Robert F. Kennedy}}
 \noindent
 GDP is a good measure for tne flow of everything that has a market price - mot as an indicator of well-being or environment.
 \\
 \textbf{Alternative measures} should take into account
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Happiness
  \item Prosperity
  \item Environment
  \item Development
 \end{itemize}
 \subsection{Rodrik, D. (2015) Economics Rules: The Rights and Wrongs of the Dismal Science }
 \noindent
 An economist should have as many different models as possible in her toolbox\\
 $\rightarrow$ choose the better model(s) for the specific research question.
 \\
 Our models are partial, thus, our conclusions are partial.

 \subsection{The four laws of thermodynamis}
 \begin{itemize}
  \item[\nth{1}] Law of thermodynamis: Energy can neither be created nor destroyed, but can change formms and flow from one place to another.
  \item[\nth{2}] Law of thermodynamis: The irreversibility of natural processes, and, in many cases, the tendency of natural processes to lead towards spatial homogeneity of matter and energy.
 \end{itemize}
 \noindent
 Important works on environmental economics
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Pigout (1920): Taxing externalities.
  \item Coase (NPE 1991): Contracting between parties.
  \item Elinor Ostrom (NPE 2012): Some communities use other mechanisms than the market for allocations etc. - and it's better than the market!
  \item Richard H. Thaler (NPE 2017): Behavioral economics (interests of firms).

 \subsection{Environmental Economics vs. Ecological Economics}
 \epigraph{"We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them"}{\textit{Albert Einstein}}
 \noindent
 Ecological Economics
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Sustainability of the world as a whole.
  \item Looking at the world as a whole, i.e. no such thing as externalities.
 \end{itemize}
 Environmental Economics
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Sustainability: Of the economy.
  \item Negative externalities: To the economy (the core).
        \begin{itemize}
         \item Uncompensated (adverse) impact of one person's action on the wellbeing of a bystander.
         \item Causes markets to be inefficient, and thus to maximize total surplus, e.g. pollution.
         \item Coase theorem: if private parties can bargain without cost over the allocation of resources, they can solve the problem of externalities on their own.
         \item Government action: Regulations (permits) or taxations (market correcting solution).
        \end{itemize}
 \end{itemize}
 \noindent
 \textbf{The Climate:}\\
 Average weather conditions that can be observed locally regionally or globally. Changes with or without human impact.
 \\ \\
 \textbf{Global warming:}
 \begin{itemize}
  \item This is what is important!
  \item Designates the increase of average temperature
  \item \textbf{Global public good:}\\
        Standard solutions to tragedy of the commons:
        \begin{itemize}
         \item Price market-based policy: Carbon tax: Arthur Pigou (1920) \textit{The Economics of Welfare}
         \item Quantity market-based policy: Cap-and-trade system: Ronald Coase (1920) \textit{The problem of social cost}
         \item Alternative methods: Polycentric approach (consensus): Elinor Ostrom (2012) \textit{GLobal Environmental Commons} (NP, 2009).
        \end{itemize}
        Options to manage the "global common"
        \begin{itemize}

\begin{multicols}{2}\noindent
 \subsection{Discussion}\noindent
 \textbf{Main features of Input-Output analysis:}
 \begin{itemize}
  \item 'From craddle to grave'
  \item Each row can use a different measure (we don't need to translate everything into Euroes).
  \item Technology ($A$) is constant within each year.
 \end{itemize}
 $\rightarrow$ Framework can be used to place the 'responsibility' of all pollution through the production-chain on the final demand.
 \\ \\
 Assuming perfect competition (and information):
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Tariff on the producer should carry through to the market prices.
  \item[$\rightarrow$] The reaction of demand should be equal to that of a final goods tariff.
 \end{itemize}
 In a \nth{2} best World:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item[$\rightarrow$] A tax on the producer is not necessarily passed on to the consumer.
  \item[$\rightarrow$] Lobbies have a lot of power.
  \item[$\rightarrow$] The consumer doesn't know what's behind the price $\rightarrow$ would (probably) act more on a tax if reported as a part of the price? (plane tickets?).
  \item[$\rightarrow$] With barcodes the production and thus pollution of a product can be traced.
 \end{itemize}
 \subsection{Single Region IO Model: Autarky}
 \textbf{Total output:}
 \begin{align*}
  x=(I-A)^{-1}y
 \end{align*}
 Where the element $x_i$ for sector $i$ is given by:
 \begin{align*}
  x_i=\frac{\delta x_i}{\delta..}\cdots
 \end{align*}
 \textcolor{red}{See slide 14 in updated 5\_EE}\\
 i.e. the output from sector $i$ due to final demand of it's product (including intermediate products from the sector itself) plus the output from sector $i$ due to the demand of intermediate products from sector $i$ to each of the other sectors $j\neq i$.

 \subsection{Single Region IO Model: Open Economy}
 \textbf{Domestic Technology Assumption (DTA):}\par
 Assumes imported goods are produced with the technology observed for the relevant domestic sector
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Strong assumption! Some sectors doesn't even exist domestically.
  \item For single region analysis in OECD-countries it can be preferred though, e.g.
        \begin{itemize}
         \item Hundreds of different sectors in single-region database;
         \item $\sim$ 30 sectors in a global database.
