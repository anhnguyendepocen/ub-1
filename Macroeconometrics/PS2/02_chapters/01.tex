\textit{This problem set builds upon the analysis of output convergence carried out in Bernard and Durlauf
(1995). According to these authors, it is possible to assess whether the economies are (stochastically)
converging in terms of logarithm of output per capita if there are long-run relationships that link these
time series. We rely on the weak definition of stochastic convergence, which assess whether time series
are cointegrated without giving any particular value for the cointegrating vector.}
